Node Fetch did not honor the `size` option after following a redirect, which means that when a content size was over the limit, a FetchError would never get thrown and the process would end without failure.\n# Remediation\nUpgrade `node-fetch` to version 2.6.1, 3.0.0-beta.9 or higher.\n# References\n- [GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/security/advisories/GHSA-w7rc-rwvf-8q5r)\n"
